The Fundamentals for Future Makers course is our first introduction to fabrication tools and technologies as students in the MDEF program. However, given my background, I was already familiar with some of these technologies and tools from my undergraduate studies. Nevertheless, it was useful to have a course like this to serve as a refresher on how to use these technologies, since it has been quite a while since I used any of them. I will admit at first I was a little worried I lost my confidence with using them, but just a quick refresher and it felt like no time had passed.
While I was familiar with certain aspects like laser cutting, 3D printing, 2D & 3D Design, casting and molding, things like working with coding on Arduino, building multimedia experiences on Touchdesigner and biomaterial creation were completely new to me and I was very much fascinated by them. I am very happy we were exposed to them because they defintely upon up a lot of new avenues.

Over the course of the nine sessions, we worked with several technologies, each time working towards completing a certain task, most times having to complete them within the same session. I would say they were pretty focused and productive sessions, but also FUN - you can't have fundamentals without the fun. Detailed below is a brief take away and documentation of the sessions.



 ### Arduino & Coding


 ### 2D Design & Fabrication


  ### 3D Design & Printing


  ### CNC Milling


  ### Casting & Molding


  ### Touchdesigner


  ### Biomaterials


Overall, I think I really enjoyed this course because felt like a good ice breaker in between all the other courses that demanded a lot of brain power and deep thinking. It felt nice to just break away and focus on making things with our hands. Working in small groups was also enjoyable and it made me realize how different our approaches can be to a simple assignment. I think working with Ayal I learnt a balance between doing something nice but not necessarily complicated. I appreciate how we were assigned simple tasks to learn how to use each technology or tool and had a tangible outcome by the end of each class. One reflection is that I wish we knew from the beginning of the course that every thing we make would somehow connect to the next technology we use because then maybe we could have been more mindful of our design choices. But regardless, learnt from the mistakes, the frustration and also had a lot of fun!
