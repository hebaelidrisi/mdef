Hello! I'm Heba Elidrisi - an Interior Designer with a passion for creating designs, moments and memories that tell stories and evoke emotion. 

Inspired by my journey across different corners of the world, I bring my global experiences into everything I create. 

Currently I am exploring and expanding my practice through the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF) at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC) in Barcelona, Spain. 

I have always been drawn to the raw honesty of earth materials, their grounding presence and quiet strength. I am curious to see how they will weave their way into my creative journey. 

For now, follow along to see how things evolve through my process, experiments and reflections!
