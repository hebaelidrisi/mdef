Initially I wanted to be perceived as chill, unserious and nonchalant. But then as time went by I decided I wanted to be playful, careless, almost child-like. (all of this was before my time as a subject began) I used the tape as a prosthetic to play with - I was wearing it on my wrist, waving it around, toying with it. At some point I almost forgot the act and the prosthetic, but I realized something - I did not have to try hard to be perceived in that light because I think I sometimes naturally do it when I\u2019m in a certain mood. I knew who my detective was within the first five minutes of my time as a subject. They tried to approach me subtly but I instantly knew what their intention was. DETECTIVE - SUBJECT: MELISSA \u00b6 12:10 PM subject says they are going to chill on the terrace 12:15 PM subject lays on the bench in what looks like an attempt to chill, headphones and sunglasses were used as a means of disconnecting herself from everyone 12:24 PM subject lifts head and removes headphones to listen and speak, engaging in conversation again 12:39 PM the subject has been laying on the bench for the past 20 minutes, connecting and disconnecting from the conversations happening 12:42 PM the subject moves their headphones over their face and away from their ears to look at other people speaking and listen to what they are saying, then looks at me. I thought she noticed me taking a picture but she didn\u2019t 12:51 PM subject asks me if I am following someone or being followed. I tell her I am being followed in this round and she believes me, doesn\u2019t seem suspicious 12:55 PM subject asks me what time it is, I tell her it\u2019s 12:55PM and that we need to head back to class. She lays back on the bench, takes a while to get up then starts moving 12:57 PM on the way to the stairs subject discusses who she thinks is following who, but does not suspect me at all, I think to myself mission successful.
